# CONLL files may have data that we currently do not represent in
# the internal format.  This file has an example of such data:
# 
# * The columns FEATS, PHEAD and PDEPREL are being ignored, and thus
#   will be deleted from output if you run::
#
#   convert.py --from=CONLL --to=CONLL IgnoredFields.conll
#
# * The column POSTAG is being ignored as well, but a value identical
#   to CPOSTAG is being used in its place when converting to CONLL,
#   so that may not always be perceivable.
