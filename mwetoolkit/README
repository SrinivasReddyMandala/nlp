Version 1.0
Released: April 16, 2015
Authors: Carlos Ramisch, Silvio Ricardo Cordeiro, Vitor de Araujo, Sandra

Project: http://sf.net/projects/mwetoolkit

The goal of the mwetoolkit is to perform automatic Multiword Expression 
extraction. Please read this documentation before you start.

    1) INSTALLING
    
(Please refer to the website for up-to-date installation documentation.)
    
To install the mwetoolkit, just download it from the SVN repository using the 
following command:

svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/mwetoolkit/code/ mwetoolkit

As the code evolves fast, we recommend you to use the SVN version instead of old
releases.

Once you have downloaded the toolkit, navigate to the main folder and run the 
command

make

for compiling the C libraries used by the toolkit. If you do not run this 
command, the toolkit will still work but it will use a Python version (much 
slower and possibly obsolete!) of the indexing and counting scripts. This may be 
OK for small corpora.

    2) SCRIPTS and PROGRAMS

The "bin" folder contains a set of Python scripts that automate part of the
MWE extraction process. Call each script with option -h and you will have
a complete list of arguments and options to use.

The "src" folder cotains source code in C. Please do not bother about it unless
you are a mwetoolkit developer.

Please refer to the website for tutorials, quick start and more documentation.

    3) EXAMPLES

The "toy" folder contains a set of files for performing a toy experiment.
You can try to run the whole pipeline by calling "./run-tutorial.sh" The 
specific documentation about the examples is in the script itself, as comments.

    4) REGRESSION TESTS
    
The "test" folder contains regression tests for most scripts. In order to test
your installation of the mwetoolkit, navigate to this folder and then call the
script testAll.sh

cd test
./testAll.sh

Should one of the tests fail, please send a copy of the output and a brief
description of your configurations (operating system, version, machine) to our
email mwetoolkit AT gmail.com

Please, beware that on Mac OS some test will appear to fail when they actually
succeed, the only differences being in rounding less significant digits of float
numbers.
