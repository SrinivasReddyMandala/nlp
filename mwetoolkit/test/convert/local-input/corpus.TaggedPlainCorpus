It can be a very complicated thing , the ocean .
And it can be a very complicated thing , what human health is .
And bringing those two together might seem a very daunting task , but what I am going to try to say is that even in that complexity , there is some simple themes that I think , if we understand , we can really move forward .
And those simple themes are not really themes about the complex science of what is going on , but things that we all pretty well know .
And I am going to start with this one : If momma am not happy , am not nobody happy .
We know that , right ?
We &apos;ve experienced that .
And if we just take that and we build from there , then we can go to the next step , which is that if the ocean am not happy , am not nobody happy .
That is the theme of my talk .
And we are making the ocean pretty unhappy in a lot of different ways .
This is a shot of Cannery Row in 1932 .
Cannery Row , at the time , had the biggest industrial <mwepart id="1">canning</mwepart> <mwepart id="1">operation</mwepart> on the west coast .
We piled enormous <mwepart id="2">amounts</mwepart> <mwepart id="2">of</mwepart> <mwepart id="2">pollution</mwepart> into the air and into the water .
Rolf Bolin , who was a professor at the Hopkin &apos;s Marine Station where I work , wrote in the 1940s that &quot; The fumes from the scum floating on the inlets of the bay were so bad they turned lead-based paints black . &quot;
People working in these canneries could barely stay there all day because of the smell , but you know what they came out saying ?
They say , You know what you smell ?
You smell money .
That pollution was money to that community , and those people dealt with the pollution and absorbed it into their skin and into their bodies because they needed the money .
We made the ocean unhappy ; we made people very unhappy , and we made them unhealthy .
The connection between <mwepart id="3">ocean</mwepart> <mwepart id="3">health</mwepart> and human health is actually based upon another couple simple adages , and I want to call that &quot; pinch a minnow , hurt a whale . &quot;
The <mwepart id="4,5">pyramid</mwepart> <mwepart id="4,5">of</mwepart> <mwepart id="4,5,6">ocean</mwepart> <mwepart id="4,6">life</mwepart> ...
Now , when an ecologist looks at the ocean -- I have to tell you -- we look at the ocean in a very different way , and we see different things than when a regular person looks at the ocean because when an ecologist looks at the ocean , we see all those interconnections .
We see the base of the <mwepart id="7">food</mwepart> <mwepart id="7">chain</mwepart> , the plankton , the small things , and we see how those animals are food to animals in the middle of the pyramid , and on so up this diagram .
And that flow , that <mwepart id="8">flow</mwepart> <mwepart id="8">of</mwepart> <mwepart id="8">life</mwepart> , from the very base up to the very top , is the flow that ecologists see .
And that is what we are trying to preserve when we say , Save the ocean .
Heal the ocean .
It is that pyramid .
Now why does that matter for human health ?
Because when we jam things in the bottom of that pyramid that should not be there , some very frightening things happen .
Pollutants , some pollutants have been created by us : molecules like PCBs that ca not be broken down by our bodies .
And they go in the base of that pyramid , and they drift up ; they are passed up that way , on to predators and on to the <mwepart id="9,14">top</mwepart> <mwepart id="9,14">predators</mwepart> , and in so doing , they accumulate .
Now , to bring that home , I thought I &apos;d invent a little game .
We do not really have to play it ; we can just think about it here .
It is the Styrofoam and <mwepart id="10">chocolate</mwepart> <mwepart id="10">game</mwepart> .
Imagine that when we got on this boat , we were all given two Styrofoam peanuts .
Ca not do much with them : Put them in your pocket .
Suppose the rules are : every time you offer somebody a drink , you give them the drink , and you give them your Styrofoam peanuts too .
What &apos;ll happen is that the Styrofoam peanuts will start moving through our society here , and they will accumulate in the drunkest , stingiest people .
There is no mechanism in this game for them to go anywhere but into a bigger and bigger pile of indigestible Styrofoam peanuts .
And that is exactly what happens with PDBs in this <mwepart id="11">food</mwepart> <mwepart id="11">pyramid</mwepart> : They accumulate into the top of it .
Now suppose , instead of Styrofoam peanuts , we take these lovely little chocolates that we get and we had those instead .
Well , some of us would be eating those chocolates instead of passing them around , and instead of accumulating , they will just pass into our group here and not accumulate in any one group because they are absorbed by us .
And that is the difference between a PCB and , say , something natural like an omega-3 , something we want out of the marine <mwepart id="7">food</mwepart> <mwepart id="7">chain</mwepart> .
PCBs accumulate .
We have great examples of that , unfortunately .
PCBs accumulate in dolphins in Sarasota Bay , in Texas , in North Carolina .
They get into the <mwepart id="7">food</mwepart> <mwepart id="7">chain</mwepart> .
The dolphins eat the fish that have PCBs from the plankton , and those PCBs , being fat-soluble , accumulate in these dolphins .
Now , a dolphin , mother dolphin , any dolphin -- there is only one way that a PCB can get out of a dolphin .
And what is that ?
In mother &apos;s milk .
Here is a diagram of the PCB <mwepart id="12">load</mwepart> <mwepart id="12">of</mwepart> <mwepart id="12">dolphins</mwepart> in Sarasota Bay .
Adult males : a huge load .
Juveniles : a huge load .
females after their first calf is already weaned : a lower load .
Those females , they are not trying to .
Those females are passing the PCBs in the fat of their own mother &apos;s milk into their offspring , and their offspring do not survive .
The <mwepart id="13">death</mwepart> <mwepart id="13">rate</mwepart> in these dolphins , for the first calf born of every female dolphin , is 60 to 80 percent .
These mothers pump their first offspring full of this pollutant , and most of them die .
Now , the mother then can go and reproduce , but what a terrible price to pay for the accumulation of this pollutant in these animals -- the death of the first-born calf .
There is another <mwepart id="9,14">top</mwepart> <mwepart id="9,14">predator</mwepart> in the ocean , it turns out .
That <mwepart id="9,14">top</mwepart> <mwepart id="9,14">predator</mwepart> , of course , is us .
And we also are eating meat that comes from some of these same places .
This is <mwepart id="15">whale</mwepart> <mwepart id="15">meat</mwepart> that I photographed in a <mwepart id="16">grocery</mwepart> <mwepart id="16">store</mwepart> in Tokyo -- or is it ?
In fact , what we did a few years ago was learn how to smuggle a molecular <mwepart id="17">biology</mwepart> <mwepart id="17">lab</mwepart> into Tokyo and use it to genetically test the DNA out of <mwepart id="15,18">whale</mwepart> <mwepart id="15,18,19">meat</mwepart> <mwepart id="18,19">samples</mwepart> and identify what they really were .
And some of those <mwepart id="15,18">whale</mwepart> <mwepart id="15,18,19">meat</mwepart> <mwepart id="18,19">samples</mwepart> were <mwepart id="15">whale</mwepart> <mwepart id="15">meat</mwepart> .
Some of them were illegal <mwepart id="15">whale</mwepart> <mwepart id="15">meat</mwepart> , by the way .
That is another story .
But some of them were not <mwepart id="15">whale</mwepart> <mwepart id="15">meat</mwepart> at all .
Even though they were labeled <mwepart id="15">whale</mwepart> <mwepart id="15">meat</mwepart> , they were dolphin meat .
Some of them were dolphin liver .
Some of them were dolphin blubber .
And those dolphin parts had a huge load of PCBs , dioxins and heavy metals .
And that huge load was passing into the people that ate this meat .
It turns out that a <mwepart id="20">lot</mwepart> <mwepart id="20">of</mwepart> <mwepart id="20">dolphins</mwepart> are being sold as meat in the <mwepart id="15,21">whale</mwepart> <mwepart id="15,21,22">meat</mwepart> <mwepart id="21,22">market</mwepart> around the world .
That is a tragedy for those populations , but it is also a tragedy for the people eating them because they do not know that that is toxic meat .
We had these data a few years ago .
I remember sitting at my desk being about the only person in the world who knew that <mwepart id="15">whale</mwepart> <mwepart id="15">meat</mwepart> being sold in these markets was really dolphin meat , and it was toxic .
It had two-to-three-to-400 times the toxic loads ever allowed by the EPA .
And I remember there sitting at my <mwepart id="23">desk</mwepart> <mwepart id="23">thinking</mwepart> , Well , I know this .
This is a great scientific discovery , but it was so awful .
And for the very first time in my scientific career , I broke scientific protocol , which is that you take the data and publish them in scientific journals and then begin to talk about them .
We sent a very polite letter to the <mwepart id="24">Minister</mwepart> <mwepart id="24">of</mwepart> <mwepart id="24">Health</mwepart> in Japan and simply pointed out that this is an intolerable situation , not for us , but for the people of Japan because mothers who may be breastfeeding , who may have young children , would be buying something that they thought was healthy , but it was really toxic .
