This is a shot of Cannery Row in 1932 .
Cannery Row , at the time , had the biggest industrial <mwepart id="1">canning</mwepart> <mwepart id="1">operation</mwepart> on the west coast .
We piled enormous <mwepart id="2">amounts</mwepart> <mwepart id="2">of</mwepart> <mwepart id="2">pollution</mwepart> into the air and into the water .
Rolf Bolin , who was a professor at the Hopkin &apos;s Marine Station where I work , wrote in the 1940s that &quot; The fumes from the scum floating on the inlets of the bay were so bad they turned lead-based paints black . &quot;
People working in these canneries could barely stay there all day because of the smell , but you know what they came out saying ?
They say , You know what you smell ?
You smell money .
That pollution was money to that community , and those people dealt with the pollution and absorbed it into their skin and into their bodies because they needed the money .
We made the ocean unhappy ; we made people very unhappy , and we made them unhealthy .
The connection between <mwepart id="3">ocean</mwepart> <mwepart id="3">health</mwepart> and human health is actually based upon another couple simple adages , and I want to call that &quot; pinch a minnow , hurt a whale . &quot;
The <mwepart id="4,5">pyramid</mwepart> <mwepart id="4,5">of</mwepart> <mwepart id="4,5,6">ocean</mwepart> <mwepart id="4,6">life</mwepart> ...
Now , when an ecologist looks at the ocean -- I have to tell you -- we look at the ocean in a very different way , and we see different things than when a regular person looks at the ocean because when an ecologist looks at the ocean , we see all those interconnections .
We see the base of the <mwepart id="7">food</mwepart> <mwepart id="7">chain</mwepart> , the plankton , the small things , and we see how those animals are food to animals in the middle of the pyramid , and on so up this diagram .
And that flow , that <mwepart id="8">flow</mwepart> <mwepart id="8">of</mwepart> <mwepart id="8">life</mwepart> , from the very base up to the very top , is the flow that ecologists see .
And that is what we are trying to preserve when we say , Save the ocean .
Heal the ocean .
It is that pyramid .
Now why does that matter for human health ?
Because when we jam things in the bottom of that pyramid that should not be there , some very frightening things happen .
Pollutants , some pollutants have been created by us : molecules like PCBs that ca not be broken down by our bodies .
And they go in the base of that pyramid , and they drift up ; they are passed up that way , on to predators and on to the <mwepart id="9,14">top</mwepart> <mwepart id="9,14">predators</mwepart> , and in so doing , they accumulate .
